Over the past month, I've been focused on building a strong foundation in competitive programming using C++. Here's a quick overview of what I've covered:

# Week 1: C++ STL, Sorting & Searching
Got hands-on with the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) – vectors, sets, maps, queues, stacks, and more.

Created and refined my own CP templates to speed up contest participation.

Revisited classic sorting algorithms (like quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and analyzed their time complexities.

Practiced efficient searching techniques, including binary search and STL-based search functions.

#  Week 2: Greedy Algorithms & Bit Manipulation
Explored greedy problem-solving strategies through a range of classic problems.

Learned to recognize when greedy works—and when it doesn't.

Practiced a variety of bit manipulation techniques (AND, OR, XOR, shifting) and learned clever tricks like subset iteration and checking power of two.

# Week 3: Mathematics & Number Theory
Dived into core math concepts vital for CP:

Modular arithmetic and properties

Fast exponentiation

Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime generation

Combinatorics and basic probability

Number-theoretic functions like Euler’s Totient and the Mobius function


# Week 4: Dynamic Programming (DP)
Practiced all major types of DP problems:

1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional DP

Subset and knapsack-style problems

Digit DP and optimization-based DP

Learned to recognize problem patterns where DP applies and how to optimize solutions with memoization and tabulation.
